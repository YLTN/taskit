# Taskit

Taskit is a task management app that allows you to put your tasks into groups and keep track of them by checking or unchecking them, editing them or completely removing them.

# Getting started

The app is divided into two directories. To get started, run these commands within the root folder of the project.

```bash
  cd frontend
  yarn
  cd ../backend
  yarn
```

If you're running a terminal, open another one and make sure you run `cd` into the frontend folder in the first one, and `cd` into the backend folder in the second one.

The front end uses `vite`, so all vite commands are available. The back end uses express and typescript so make sure you run `yarn build`, then `yarn start`. You could also run `yarn dev` to run an auto-reloading development server.
Make sure you rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill the variables correspondingly.
